# Spaceship Titanic — Data cleaning, feature engineering and exploration

This repository contains a small Kaggle-style data science project for the "Spaceship Titanic" dataset. The work is organized as a single Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`) and the raw dataset files are in the `data/` directory. The goal is to prepare the data and experiment with features to predict the `Transported` label.

Repository structure
--------------------
- `main.ipynb` — the analysis notebook with preprocessing, EDA and model experiments.
- `data/train.csv` — training dataset.
- `data/test.csv` — test dataset.
- `data/sample_submission.csv` — sample submission format.
- `submission.csv` — optional saved submission.
